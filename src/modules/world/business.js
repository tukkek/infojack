//Corporation are the offline counterpart of Systems and they can be easily serialized, with system being regenerated. See GitHub issue #44.
//Although a Corporation can have several systems, better to stick to a 1:1 relationship at first. See GitHub issue #45.

//TODO generate all available Corporations at save start, 1d4 per level (1-20). make sure names don't overlap.
